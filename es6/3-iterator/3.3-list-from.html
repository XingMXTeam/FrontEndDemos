    List.from
    Here is our List class again. In ES6, Array has a static method from, which does the thing that you'd now use
    Array.prototype.slice.call for—turn an array-like object (like arguments or node.childNodes) into a real array. If
    its argument it iterable, it'll take the values from the iterator, and create an array from that. If not, it'll look
    for a length property, and use integer indexes to fetch element values.

    Add a static from method to the List class, which behaves the same way: It takes a single argument. If that argument
    is iterable (has a Symbol.iterator property), it iterates of it, and creates a list from its content. If not, it
    loops over the object's indices (using .length), and builds a list from its content.

    Note that lists are easiest to build from back to front. You might want to first convert an iterable to an array to
    make building your list easier. Alternatively, use mutation to build the list front-to-back.

    console.log(List.from([3, 2, 1]))
// → List{head: 3, tail: List{head: 2, tail: List{head: 1, tail: null}}}
